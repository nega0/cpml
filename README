cpml
====

"cpml" was originally developed by Tavis Ormandy for benchmarking the
Compaq Portable Math Library[1] against libm on Alpha bases
systems. You can read more about his project and original code at
http://taviso.decsystem.org/cpml.html

Looking for similar benchmarks for AMD's LibM[2], I found and adapted his
code to my needs (x86_64 Opterons). Tavis gave me permission to
release my changes, with his original code being licensed under the
GPLv2.

In no way is this software meant to be scientific, accurate or even
correct. It was written solely to answer the question "Is it worth my
time to investigate using these alternative math libraries?" There are
current issues which reduce the accuracy of this code on AMD hardware,
such as the direct use of the TSC being susceptible to drift. This may
or may not be addressed in the future. 

Future plans
------------

 * timing issues mentioned above. maybe.
 * Intel MKL. Comparisons of one vendor's library on their
   competitor's hardware are suspect, but would be convenient for
   vendor library on vendor hardware comparisons.
 * pretty print and parsable output options. I changed the original
   pretty print to be more parsable for my use.
 * multiple runs, and averaging of those runs.
